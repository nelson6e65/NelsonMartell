## Description
Provides a set of classes for PHP applications.

**Note**: This is an unstable repository in development and should be treated as an ***alpha***.

## Requirements
* PHP 5.5 or greater
* [CakePHP Utility Classes](https://github.com/cakephp/utility) [3.0.5](https://github.com/cakephp/utility/releases/tag/3.0.5) or grater - Only needed `Cake\Utility\Text` class, that should be loaded. There is a [copy of that class](vendor/Cake/Utility/Text.php) into `vendor` directory to be auto-used if CakePHP Utility Classes is not available.

## Installation
Use this instructions to install **NML** into your `vendor` directory as `nelson6e65/php_nml`.

### Before install
This instructions assumes that your current directory is your *project root directory*. Use CD command as you need (`cd path/to/your/project/root`) before to proceed.

Example: If your project is located at `/home/ltorvalds/github/awesome-php-project`, run:

    cd /home/ltorvalds/github/awesome-php-project

**Note**: You may need to install [Git](http://git-scm.com) or/and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) in order to run some commands in the next steps.

### Install

#### Via composer
Just run this command (your `composer.json` will be updated):

    composer require nelson6e65/php_nml

**Note**: Remember to add your `vendor` dependencies to your `.gitignore` file. (See [why](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md)).

Read more about Composer installs [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

#### Via git submodule

    git submodule add https://github.com/nelson6e65/php_nml.git vendor/nelson6e65/php_nml
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

**Note**: You can use ssh (`git@github.com:nelson6e65/php_nml.git`) instead of https.

Read more about Git submodules [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

#### Manually
- Download the latest [release](https://github.com/nelson6e65/php_nml/releases).
- Unzip that download.
- Rename the resulting folder to `php_nml`.
- Then move this folder into your `vendor/nelson6e65` directory (create parent folders as needed).


### After install
After you install NML, you should configure your app to autoload classes.

#### For composer projects
You must include the composer autoloader (`vendor/autoload.php`) in your `config.php` or `bootstrap.php` (or whatever file that you perform autoload). In most of modern PHP frameworks this is made automatically.

#### For non-composer projects
This library implements an auto-load system even for non-composer installs. You must include the [autoloader](autoload.php) provided (`vendor/nelson6e65/php_nml/autoload.php`).

Example:

```php
<?php
    # app/config.php
    # . . .

    require_once(PROJECT_ROOT.'/vendor/nelson6e65/php_nml/autoload.php');
    // Note: 'PROJECT_ROOT' is your root directory (in this case, a PHP constant).

    # . . .
```




**Note:** There is a minimal copy of [CakePHP Utility Classes](https://github.com/cakephp/utility) in `php_nml/vendor/Cake/Utility` directory. `vendor/nelson6e65/php_nml/autoload.php` includes  `vendor/nelson6e65/php_nml/vendor/autoload.php` file to autoloads that class(es) if there is not available.


#### Code Analysis
You can, optionally, define the `CODE_ANALYSIS` constant if you like some notices and warnings to be
throws while you are coding/debugging. This is useful to watch some recommendations about usage of
some classes, functions, methods, etc.

```php
<?php
    # app/config.php
    # . . .

    define('CODE_ANALYSIS', true);

    # . . .
```


## Usage
After install NML and configure your application, you will be able to use NML classes by importing/aliasing with the [use operator](http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.importing.php):

```php
<?php
//Example of Version usage:
use NelsonMartell\Version;

// Create Version object using constructor:
$nmlVersion = new Version(0, 5, 1);

// Create Version object parsing from string
$nmlVersion = Version::parse('0.5.1');

// Explicit to string
echo $nmlVersion->toString();

// Implicit to string
echo $nmlVersion;
?>

<p>Nelson Martell Library, version <?= $nmlVersion ?></p>

```

For more details about available classes from NML, you can check the [API Documentation](http://nelson6e65.github.io/php_nml/api).
